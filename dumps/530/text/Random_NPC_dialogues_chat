ELFWhen talking to an Elf, it may say "Stay back, human. You don't know what you're dealing with," which is an exact quote from the first Artemis Fowl book. The quote in question is said by Holly Short (who is also an elf) to Artemis Fowl when they meet for the first time.
CAVE GOBLIN Upon being attacked, they will scream "Nooo!", "Don't hurt us!" or "Eeek!" and near by Cave goblins will try and flee.
