***

### How to play

To start the mini game, players must speak to [Murcaily](https://runescape.wiki/w/Murcaily "Murcaily") on the east side of the village, near the mahogany and teak woodcutting area. He will tell them about the people who have started to return only to find their village overrun by jungle and other nasty surprises. He will then tell the player that in order to help out, they must help rebuild and reinforce the village fence by cutting the jungle. In return they will gain favour, which may be exchanged with villagers for [trading sticks](https://runescape.wiki/w/Trading_sticks "Trading sticks").

***

### Earning favour

There are three different ways to earn favour from villagers:

*   Cutting the jungle

*   Repairing the village fences

*   Killing threats to the village

***

### **Cutting the jungle**

There are three types of jungle surrounding the village, with light being the most common and dense the most rare. A [machete](https://runescape.wiki/w/Machete "Machete") is required to cut them. [Woodcutting](https://runescape.wiki/w/Woodcutting "Woodcutting") experience is gained from hacking these jungles.

*   Light - level 10 woodcutting required, gives 32 experience. Easy to cut but more spars required for repairing the fence.

*   Medium - level 20 woodcutting required, gives 55 experience. Slightly more difficult and slower to cut but less thatching spars required.

*   Dense - level 35 woodcutting required, gives 80 experience. Difficult to cut and relatively slow, but very good for repairing the fence.


Clearing a patch of jungle may reveal a [Gem rock](https://runescape.wiki/w/Gem_rock "Gem rock"), which can be mined for 3 gems, or a [Gout tuber](https://runescape.wiki/w/Gout_tuber "Gout tuber"), which is needed for the [Karamja Diary](https://runescape.wiki/w/Karamja_Diary "Karamja Diary").

***

### **Repairing the village fences**

[File:Repair-fence.png](https://runescape.wiki/w/Special:Upload?wpDestFile=Repair-fence.png "File:Repair-fence.png")

The rotten village fence can be repaired with a [machete](https://runescape.wiki/w/Machete "Machete") and [thatch spars](https://runescape.wiki/w/Thatch_spar "Thatch spar") obtained from cutting jungle. Village fences may be repaired with different types of thatch spars. 5 light spars, 4 medium spars, or 3 dense spars will repair each fence. After having been repaired, the fence can be reinforced the same way.

As the fence decays continually, the repairs made by a player will eventually collapse.

***

### **Killing threats to the village**

Several types of enemies may attack players while they are hacking the jungle. These enemies are random. All poison caused by the poisonous enemies in this activity will start at 60 life points per hit.

| Monster | Level | Drops | Notes | Poisonous? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Giant mosquito](https://runescape.wiki/w/Giant_mosquito "Giant mosquito") | 13  | 1 - 2 (uncommon) [Proboscis](https://runescape.wiki/w/Proboscis "Proboscis") | Yields some [Agility](https://runescape.wiki/w/Agility "Agility") experience when killed. Used to create [Spirit Mosquito Pouch](https://runescape.wiki/w/Spirit_mosquito#pouch "Spirit mosquito") (Requires level 17 [Summoning](https://runescape.wiki/w/Summoning "Summoning").) | No  |
| [Mosquito Swarm](https://runescape.wiki/w/Mosquito_Swarm "Mosquito Swarm") | 17, 20 | 3(17)- 5(20) [Proboscis](https://runescape.wiki/w/Proboscis "Proboscis") | Yields some [Agility](https://runescape.wiki/w/Agility "Agility") experience when killed.Also used to create [Spirit Mosquito Pouch](https://runescape.wiki/w/Spirit_mosquito#pouch "Spirit mosquito"). | No  |
| [Tribesman](https://runescape.wiki/w/Tribesman "Tribesman") | 32  | See the [Tribesman](https://runescape.wiki/w/Tribesman "Tribesman") article | \-  | Yes |
| [Bush snake](https://runescape.wiki/w/Bush_snake "Bush snake") | 35  | [Snake hide](https://runescape.wiki/w/Snake_hide "Snake hide") | Snake hide may be used in [Crafting](https://runescape.wiki/w/Crafting "Crafting") to craft snakeskin armour. | Yes |
| [Jungle spider](https://runescape.wiki/w/Jungle_spider "Jungle spider") | 44  | [Spider carcass](https://runescape.wiki/w/Spider_carcass "Spider carcass") | Spider carcass can be attached to [Skewer sticks](https://runescape.wiki/w/Skewer_stick "Skewer stick") made by using a [machete](https://runescape.wiki/w/Machete "Machete") to [thatching spars](https://runescape.wiki/w/Thatch_spar "Thatch spar") to make a [Spider on stick](https://runescape.wiki/w/Spider_on_stick "Spider on stick"). It can be cooked for food. Spider carcass can also be used for making the [Summoning](https://runescape.wiki/w/Summoning "Summoning") [Spirit spider pouch](https://runescape.wiki/w/Spirit_spider#Spirit_spider_pouch "Spirit spider") (Requires level 10 [Summoning](https://runescape.wiki/w/Summoning "Summoning")). | No  |
| [Broodoo victim](https://runescape.wiki/w/Broodoo_victim "Broodoo victim") | 60  | [Tribal mask](https://runescape.wiki/w/Tribal_mask "Tribal mask") | _See below_ | No  |

An effective way of earning favour is by killing tribesmen within the village. It is advisable that players carry some [antipoison](https://runescape.wiki/w/Antipoison "Antipoison") and [food](https://runescape.wiki/w/Food "Food"), as tribesmen are known to [poison](https://runescape.wiki/w/Poison "Poison") players. Each kill earns the player 2% favour.

***

#### **Broodoo victims**

[Broodoo victims](https://runescape.wiki/w/Broodoo_victim "Broodoo victim") are an enemy category of their own. They have a [combat level](https://runescape.wiki/w/Combat_level "Combat level") of 60 and come in three different colours. Their powerful and far-ranging magic attacks are the reason [dragonhide armour](https://runescape.wiki/w/Dragonhide_armour "Dragonhide armour") and/or [Protect from Magic](https://runescape.wiki/w/Protect_from_Magic "Protect from Magic") are strongly advised for the activity, as their spells tend to drain about four levels from [Attack](https://runescape.wiki/w/Attack "Attack"), [Strength](https://runescape.wiki/w/Strength "Strength"), [Defence](https://runescape.wiki/w/Defence "Defence"), [Constitution](https://runescape.wiki/w/Constitution "Constitution"), [Magic](https://runescape.wiki/w/Magic "Magic"), and [Ranged](https://runescape.wiki/w/Ranged "Ranged") in a single hit. Though they may be killed by normal means by using [protect from magic](https://runescape.wiki/w/Protect_from_Magic "Protect from Magic") prayer, each colour has a specific weakness relating to how they were killed.

*   White - [Food](https://runescape.wiki/w/Food "Food") (any kind, but potatoes, cabbages, or onions in sacks save lots of inventory space)

*   Green - regular or super [Antipoison](https://runescape.wiki/w/Antipoison "Antipoison")\- barbarian mixes **will not** work!

*   Orange - [Relicym's balm](https://runescape.wiki/w/Relicym%27s_balm "Relicym's balm")


Broodoo victims drop [tribal masks](https://runescape.wiki/w/Tribal_mask "Tribal mask"). Using a hammer with a mask, two [snakeskins](https://runescape.wiki/w/Snakeskin "Snakeskin"), and eight [nails](https://runescape.wiki/w/Nails "Nails"), will make a [broodoo shield](https://runescape.wiki/w/Broodoo_shield "Broodoo shield").

***

## Collecting trading sticks

[![](https://runescape.wiki/images/Favour.png?18002)](https://runescape.wiki/w/File:Favour.png)

Almost every villager in the area will give a player [trading sticks](https://runescape.wiki/w/Trading_sticks "Trading sticks") in return for some of their favour percentage. The amount of trading sticks received at any one time depends on the player's favour. 100% favour will get you exactly 1,000 [trading sticks](https://runescape.wiki/w/Trading_sticks "Trading sticks"). The same amount of [trading sticks](https://runescape.wiki/w/Trading_sticks "Trading sticks") will be received if wearing villager clothes sold by Gabooty, but you will receive them faster.

Once players have claimed trading sticks from a villager they must wait a set period of time before they can ask the same person for trading sticks again. Once the favour percentage runs out, the villagers will no longer give trading sticks. Villagers who have more trading sticks visibly carry the trading sticks for the player to see.

***

### **Villagers**

[A villager with trading sticks.](https://runescape.wiki/w/Special:Upload?wpDestFile=Gabooty_with_trading_sticks.PNG "File:Gabooty with trading sticks.PNG")

Trading sticks are supplied by villagers who are spread around the village. Some of them are located at upper levels, while others wander outside the village fences. The villagers also move about, and it may take some effort to find them.

The villagers who supply trading sticks are as follows:

*   [Fanellaman](https://runescape.wiki/w/Fanellaman "Fanellaman")

*   [Gabooty](https://runescape.wiki/w/Gabooty "Gabooty")

*   [Jagbakoba](https://runescape.wiki/w/Jagbakoba "Jagbakoba")

*   [Karaday](https://runescape.wiki/w/Karaday "Karaday")

*   [Layleen](https://runescape.wiki/w/Layleen "Layleen")

*   [Mama Buffeta](https://runescape.wiki/w/Mama_Buffeta "Mama Buffeta")

*   [Murcaily](https://runescape.wiki/w/Murcaily "Murcaily")

*   [Rionasta](https://runescape.wiki/w/Rionasta "Rionasta")

*   [Safta Doc](https://runescape.wiki/w/Safta_Doc "Safta Doc")

*   [Sharimika](https://runescape.wiki/w/Sharimika "Sharimika")

***

## Rionasta's Parcel Service

In addition to supplying trading sticks, [Rionasta](https://runescape.wiki/w/Rionasta "Rionasta") offers a service of providing players the means to store items in their bank without a lengthy trip to a bank in [Ardougne](https://runescape.wiki/w/Ardougne "Ardougne") or [Shilo Village](https://runescape.wiki/w/Shilo_Village_(city) "Shilo Village (city)").

Banking any item costs 10 trading sticks. Stackable items are considered as individual items; for example, sending a stack of 50 arrows will cost 500 trading sticks. The service can be accessed by speaking to Rionasta and asking what he does around there.

**Note:** Rionasta only lets players bank items, not withdraw them. His service also does not include currency, whether it be coins or trading sticks.

## Tips

### **Proboscis**

*   If you ever find yourself low on cash, [proboscides](https://runescape.wiki/w/Proboscis "Proboscis") are a great way to earn money.

*   They go for around 11,352 coins, and considering that they stack, that can be a lot of cash.

*   A quick way to find [Mosquitoe swarms](https://runescape.wiki/w/Mosquito_Swarm "Mosquito Swarm") is to hack dense jungle until mosquitoes appear. They also give varying [Agility](https://runescape.wiki/w/Agility "Agility") exp, which can also be rewarding.

***

### **Getting trading sticks**

*   Trading sticks can be bought in the [Grand Exchange](https://runescape.wiki/w/Grand_Exchange "Grand Exchange") for 13 coins each.

*   Gems can be mined in [Shilo Village](https://runescape.wiki/w/Shilo_Village_(city) "Shilo Village (city)"), cut, and traded to [Gabooty](https://runescape.wiki/w/Gabooty "Gabooty"). This is faster than waiting for random gems to appear while hacking in the jungle.

*   Killing Jogres (in dungeon north of village) and Hobgoblins (located south of village) will sometimes drop trading sticks.

***

### **Gout tuber**

*   A quick way to find [Gout tuber](https://runescape.wiki/w/Gout_tuber "Gout tuber") is by hacking light jungle with a [Red topaz machete](https://runescape.wiki/w/Red_topaz_machete "Red topaz machete") until a goutweed tuber appears. Then, a spade can be used on it to dig up the tuber. This can be repeated by dropping the [thatch spars](https://runescape.wiki/w/Thatch_spar "Thatch spar"), and continuing to hack light jungle.

*   The tuber can either: be sold to [Gabooty](https://runescape.wiki/w/Gabooty "Gabooty"), or planted and grown with the [Farming](https://runescape.wiki/w/Farming "Farming") skill to trade to [Sanfew](https://runescape.wiki/w/Sanfew "Sanfew") in [Taverley](https://runescape.wiki/w/Taverley "Taverley") for other herbs.

*   Due to its rarity and its use in the [Karamja Diary](https://runescape.wiki/w/Karamja_Diary "Karamja Diary"), goutweed tubers used to be sold to other players for a considerable price. Before the Grand Exchange update, many people were willing to buy gout tubers for more than 200,000 coins. The current [Grand Exchange](https://runescape.wiki/w/Grand_Exchange "Grand Exchange") market price is 7,205,088 coins each. The method of farming for tubers is known as "Tubering".

*   If you choose to eat a gout tuber, it will restore 100% of your run energy. However, this is not advised due to their high value.

*   If you dig up the same [Gout tuber](https://runescape.wiki/w/Gout_tuber "Gout tuber") at the same time with someone else, both players will get a [Gout tuber](https://runescape.wiki/w/Gout_tuber "Gout tuber").

***

### **Broodoo victims**

![](https://runescape.wiki/w/Special:Upload?wpDestFile=Whitebroodoovictim.png)

A player using food on a white broodoo victim.

*   Essentials to take for killing Broodoo victims: [Food](https://runescape.wiki/w/Food "Food"), [Antipoison potions](https://runescape.wiki/w/Antipoison "Antipoison") and [Relicym's balm](https://runescape.wiki/w/Relicym%27s_balm "Relicym's balm"), although for high level players taking the victims on would not be very hard.

*   The [Broodoo mask](https://runescape.wiki/w/Tribal_mask "Tribal mask") may be turned into a [Broodoo shield](https://runescape.wiki/w/Broodoo_shield "Broodoo shield"), as this gives better protection.

*   A [Dragon dagger(p+)](https://runescape.wiki/w/Dragon_dagger "Dragon dagger") or [Dragon dagger(p++)](https://runescape.wiki/w/Dragon_dagger "Dragon dagger") may be used to kill Broodoo victims quickly.

*   As it is very troublesome to acquire [Relicym's balm](https://runescape.wiki/w/Relicym%27s_balm "Relicym's balm"), some choose to avoid the Yellow masked Broodoo victims entirely and relocate to another part of the jungle.

*   An effective method is available to players who have completed the [Tai Bwo Wannai Trio](https://runescape.wiki/w/Tai_Bwo_Wannai_Trio "Tai Bwo Wannai Trio") quest, as they have access to the [Prayer](https://runescape.wiki/w/Prayer "Prayer") altar (the statue north of the village). When fighting a Broodoo, [Protect from Magic](https://runescape.wiki/w/Protect_from_Magic "Protect from Magic") prayer is turned on, and the Broodoo victim is attacked using a Dragon dagger (p+ or p++). This way, no items are wasted fighting the Broodoo, and prayer can be recharged after the Broodoo victim is dead.

***

### **Other tips**

*   It is advisable not to wear armour if it can be avoided. [Ranged](https://runescape.wiki/w/Ranged "Ranged") gear is recommended as it is lighter and will be more efficient in the gathering of materials. In addition, the Broodoo victim's magic attacks are less likely to be damaging with Ranged armour on.

*   When hacking jungle, players should move around to avoid attacks from threats of the village.

*   Gem rocks can be mined with a [pickaxe](https://runescape.wiki/w/Pickaxe "Pickaxe") to obtain three gems of any kind, including both regular gems and all three [Shilo Village](https://runescape.wiki/w/Shilo_Village_(city) "Shilo Village (city)") gems. But be careful, if there's another player nearby with a pickaxe when you find a gem rock, they will be able to mine the gem rock, too, sometimes fully mining it before you get even one gem.

*   The [Jungle spiders](https://runescape.wiki/w/Jungle_spider "Jungle spider") can be killed, skewered, then cooked on the fires south of the village. Skewers are obtained by using a Machete on a [Thatch spar](https://runescape.wiki/w/Thatch_spar "Thatch spar").

*   The [chickens](https://runescape.wiki/w/Chicken "Chicken") in the village can be killed and cooked for food. Spiders are also alternatives for food.

*   If using prayer when attacking you can go and recharge you prayer points at the Tribal Statue

*   You may also use [pineapples](https://runescape.wiki/w/Pineapple "Pineapple") for food or against White [Broodoo victims](https://runescape.wiki/w/Broodoo_victim "Broodoo victim"). If sliced, they will heal up to 80 LP. They are located South-west of [Brimhaven](https://runescape.wiki/w/Brimhaven "Brimhaven"). (You need a [knife](https://runescape.wiki/w/Knife "Knife") to cut pineapples.)

*   One more way of getting food for healing is buying raw karambwan after Tai Bwo Wannai Trio

*   If you bring noted supplies and coins, you can use the general store to the north of the village to un-note the items and extend your trips.

***

## Trivia

*   The poisonous creatures involved in the activity used to inflict an 110 damage poison condition. The poison damage was recently lowered to 68 in a hidden update, perhaps due to complaints from players.
*   There is a random graphical glitch where if dense jungle is cut down, its right click and examine text along with colour, are that of light jungle.
*   This is the only way to obtain Trading Sticks besides killing Jogres and Hobgoblins (located south of village) and buying it off the Grand Exchange.
