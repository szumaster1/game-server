## **Gnome Restaurant** 

***

is a [minigame](https://runescape.wiki/w/Minigame "Minigame") that involves [Gnome cooking](https://runescape.wiki/w/Gnome_cooking "Gnome cooking") and delivering the food to your customers as quickly as possible. To start the minigame, players have to talk to [Aluft Gianne Jr](https://runescape.wiki/w/Aluft_Gianne_Jr "Aluft Gianne Jr") in the [Grand Tree](https://runescape.wiki/w/Grand_Tree "Grand Tree"), in the [Tree Gnome Stronghold](https://runescape.wiki/w/Tree_Gnome_Stronghold "Tree Gnome Stronghold"). Please note that this is a **"Safe"** mini-game. You will not die, unless you are poisoned or take damage _during_ a delivery.

It is strongly recommended that you have completed [The Grand Tree](https://runescape.wiki/w/The_Grand_Tree "The Grand Tree") quest to gain access to the [gnome gliders](https://runescape.wiki/w/Gnome_glider "Gnome glider").

***

## Seeking Employment

Players start by speaking to [Aluft Gianne Jr](https://runescape.wiki/w/Aluft_Gianne_Jr "Aluft Gianne Jr") in the [Grand Tree](https://runescape.wiki/w/Grand_Tree "Grand Tree"). He is located north of the bank on the first floor. He will ask the player to speak to [Aluft Gianne Sr](https://runescape.wiki/w/Aluft_Gianne_Sr "Aluft Gianne Sr") to learn the art of [Gnome cooking](https://runescape.wiki/w/Gnome_cooking "Gnome cooking"), and then to [Blurberry](https://runescape.wiki/w/Blurberry "Blurberry") to learn the art of Gnome [cocktails](https://runescape.wiki/w/Cocktail "Cocktail").

[Aluft Gianne Sr](https://runescape.wiki/w/Aluft_Gianne_Sr "Aluft Gianne Sr"), located one platform east of Junior, will get the player to prepare four different gnome dishes. Players may trade [Hudo](https://runescape.wiki/w/Hudo "Hudo"), located just to the north, to get any additional ingredients if they mess up. They can also use the Gnome [cooking range](https://runescape.wiki/w/Cooking_range "Cooking range") to cook the food.

[Blurberry](https://runescape.wiki/w/Blurberry "Blurberry") is located on the same floor, but in the south-east section of the tree. He will get the player to prepare four different cocktails. Players may trade [Heckel Funch](https://runescape.wiki/w/Heckel_Funch "Heckel Funch") just to the east to get additional ingredients if they mess up.

Once players have completed the cooking and cocktail-making, they can now run a delivery service around _RuneScape_. The sequence is...

*   Getting a new task from [Aluft Gianne Jnr](https://runescape.wiki/w/Aluft_Gianne_Jr "Aluft Gianne Jr").

*   Making the gnome food or cocktail required.

*   Delivering the food to the required destination within the time limit.


Players are given a [delivery box](https://runescape.wiki/w/Delivery_box "Delivery box"), which they can click on at any time to refresh their memory as to what the current required food and destination is. The player may choose an easy task which involves walking from the [Grand Tree](https://runescape.wiki/w/Grand_Tree "Grand Tree") to somewhere close (within the [Gnome Stronghold](https://runescape.wiki/w/Gnome_Stronghold "Gnome Stronghold")) to deliver the food, or a hard task that involves a customer anywhere in _RuneScape_. Easy tasks generally have a time limit of around 6 minutes, whereas Hard tasks are usually around 11 minutes.

Because a bank is very close to Junior, all the player should have in his inventory are [Coins](https://runescape.wiki/w/Coins "Coins") and possibly a few [Teleports](https://runescape.wiki/w/Teleport "Teleport"). An [Amulet of Glory](https://runescape.wiki/w/Amulet_of_Glory "Amulet of Glory") and [Ring of duelling](https://runescape.wiki/w/Ring_of_duelling "Ring of duelling") are useful for returning to the [Grand Tree](https://runescape.wiki/w/Grand_Tree "Grand Tree") via the [Gnome glider](https://runescape.wiki/w/Gnome_glider "Gnome glider"). Also, the [Mobilising Armies](https://runescape.wiki/w/Mobilising_Armies "Mobilising Armies") teleport is useful as it is between a bank and a spirit tree.

***

## Food and Drinks

Generally, all ingredients are available by trading either [Heckel Funch](https://runescape.wiki/w/Heckel_Funch "Heckel Funch") (for cocktail ingredients) or [Hudo](https://runescape.wiki/w/Hudo "Hudo") (for cooking ingredients). The only two items which cannot be obtained are [King worms](https://runescape.wiki/w/King_worm "King worm") and [Toad's legs](https://runescape.wiki/w/Toad%27s_legs "Toad's legs"), both of which can be found just west of the tree itself in the swamp area. These items can also be [pickpocketed](https://runescape.wiki/w/Thieving "Thieving") from [Gnomes](https://runescape.wiki/w/Gnome "Gnome"). Or another, more uncommon way, is to keep talking with a [Gnome](https://runescape.wiki/w/Gnome "Gnome") until it gives you either item. It may take four or more tries.

The player may buy manuals, such as the Gnome cocktail manual and the Gnome cooking manual, but this is generally unnecessary.

Some players make all the food in sets of 100s beforehand, just so they can do the delivery more quickly. It does help the chances of a tip, so if you have the time and bank space, doing so would speed up the game a great deal.

## Rewards

For each delivery, there is a reward token. For fast deliveries, there is an increased chance of obtaining a good tip. Being able to make fast "hard deliveries" is a good way to obtain decent rewards from this minigame.

### **Reward Tokens**

*   Players receive _points_ for completing a delivery. Every 'easy' delivery gives one point. Hard deliveries earn 3 points.

*   After obtaining 12 points, the first token is given.

*   After that, every 12 points earned gives an additional food item to be delivered. Players can have up to 10 items of food delivered to them at once. This is not instantaneous, and these will be Gnome food (such as those served in Grand Tree, and those made during the game). Players will need free inventory spots to hold the food.

*   Outside the Tzhaar [Fight Caves](https://runescape.wiki/w/Fight_Caves "Fight Caves"), [Bones to Peaches](https://runescape.wiki/w/Bones_to_Peaches "Bones to Peaches") is a much better option. (This token may help the player restore a great deal of [Hitpoints](https://runescape.wiki/w/Hitpoints "Hitpoints") in the [Fight Caves](https://runescape.wiki/w/Fight_Caves "Fight Caves") if used properly.)

*   **NOTE:** Players can own two (or more) unique items at once as tips (such as [Gnome scarf](https://runescape.wiki/w/Gnome_scarf "Gnome scarf") or [Gnome goggles](https://runescape.wiki/w/Gnome_goggles "Gnome goggles")). So, it is possible to have [Gnome goggles](https://runescape.wiki/w/Gnome_goggles "Gnome goggles") as a tip, then get them again as another tip while still owning one pair, although the instances are rare.

## Trivia

*   Before a significant [update](https://runescape.wiki/w/Update:Gnome_Cuisine "Update:Gnome Cuisine") to this minigame on [7 August](https://runescape.wiki/w/7_August "7 August") [2006](https://runescape.wiki/w/2006 "2006"), players could potentially ruin a dish by adding the wrong ingredients in the wrong order. Doing so would result in an _Odd cocktail_, _Odd batta_, _Odd gnomebowl_, or _Odd crunchies_. The Odd cuisine would heal a small amount of health, but would lower combat stats.

*   Until the aforementioned update in 2006, players could be assigned multiple drinks or dishes and were always required to give them to [Blurberry](https://runescape.wiki/w/Blurberry "Blurberry") or [Aluft Gianne Sr](https://runescape.wiki/w/Aluft_Gianne_Sr "Aluft Gianne Sr"), depending on if it was a dish or a cocktail. Players were then compensated with coins, rarely more than a few hundred.

*   Players were able to skip a delivery and get another one immediately. To do that they must have a gnome token (in bank or inventory) and drop the delivery box. This can be repeated many times until they get someone they want. This bug was fixed in November - December, 2008.

*   After completion of [While Guthix Sleeps](https://runescape.wiki/w/While_Guthix_Sleeps "While Guthix Sleeps"), the player may be assigned to send food to Hazelmere, but the player will inform Gianne jnr. of his death then be reassigned to another order.

*   This minigame was actually the first to be released. It was launched on [December 12](https://runescape.wiki/w/December_12 "December 12"), [2002](https://runescape.wiki/w/2002 "2002") with the agility skill and the Gnome Stronghold area. However, it was not officially designated as a minigame until its major expansion in August 2006.
