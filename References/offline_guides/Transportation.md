## Transportation methods

***

### Introduction

In your many endeavours to explore and experience the wonders of the RuneScape world, you will have undoubtedly come
across the problems of traversing great distances in the shortest possible time - to get to a party on time, your next
clue location or to meet your friend like you promised. Read on to learn about the many ways of saving time, taking
shortcuts and avoiding long walks in the wonderful scenery. You might want to use the Jagex world map which pops up in
game by clicking the world picture next to your minimap, or alternatively utilise our
own [interactive world map](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=atlas.htm) when
getting around. The transportation icons (arrows) on the maps quickly identify key locations.

### Energy

In the Player Controls menu in the RuneScape interface, you have the option of choosing to walk or run from where you
are at the moment to where you click to go next. Running is twice the speed of walking.

To select run mode you need to click on the run
icon ![Run Speed](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028im_/http://www.tip.it/runescape/img2/beginners_Run-Speed-Icon.gif)
found on the Game Options menu.

**Game Options**

It is also possible to run for a short time instead of running until your energy is consumed. Just hold CTRL when you
click and you will run until you reach that spot. The next time you click, assuming you aren't still holding CTRL, you
will be walking again

However, the two factors of Energy and Weight will play a vital role when you consider whether to walk or run. When you
walk, you do not lose energy. When you run, you lose energy depending on how much weight you are carrying. The more
weight you are carrying, the faster you will lose energy while running. Energy recovers automatically back up to 100%
when you are not running. To check your weight, you need to open the equipment stats menu. The total weight carried is
shown.

Members can wear the 'Boots of Lightness' obtainable from
the [Temple of Ikov](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=temple_of_ikov.htm)
which reduce your weight by 4kg.

Members with the necessary hunter level can wear one of two capes to further reduce their weight. These capes are made
from furs obtained
through [Falconry.](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=hunting_guide.htm#falconry)
Spotted capes reduce the wearer's weight by 2-3 kg and require a Hunter level of 40. Spottier capes reduce weight by 4-5
kg and require a Hunter level of 66. See the clothing section in
the [Hunter](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=hunting_guide.htm#clothing)
guide for details. Players who have the necessary points playing
the [Barbarian Assault](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=barbarian_assault.htm)
Mini game can purchase a set of Penance Gloves that reduce their weight by 4-5 kg.
For members, the higher your agility the faster your energy will recover. For level 1 agility you regain 1% energy
around every 7 seconds. For level 99 agility, you regain 1% energy around every 2.5 seconds. This restoration advantage
**does carry over** to free servers as well.

The following items are useful to speed up the rate your energy is restored:

- 'Strange fruit' you can pick from the 'strange plant' random event can instantly give you energy back. When you eat
  it, you gain 30% energy.
- Bandages
  in [Castle Wars](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=castle_wars.htm) restore

  from [Garden of Tranquillity](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=115)

- Drinking Energy potion restores 10% per dose and Super energy potion restores 20% per dose (see
  the [Herblore guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=herblore_guide.htm)).
- Drinking Sq'irk Juice, made from Winter, Spring, Autumn, or Summer fruit from
  the [Sorceress's Garden](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=sorceress_garden.htm#juice)
  mini game, will restore 5, 10, 15 or 20% of your energy, respectively.
- Summer Pie restores 10% energy (as well as boosting agility by 5;
  see [Cooking Guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=cooking_guide.htm)).
- Hard-to-find goutweed tubers can be obtained at random while cleaning
  up [Tai Bwo Wannai](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=taibwowannai_cleanup.htm)
  village; eating them restores a whopping 50% of your energy.
- While playing
  the [Gnome Delivery](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=gnome_restaurant.htm)
  mini game it is possible to obtain a Gnomish Mint Cake as a reward. These little bars are packed full of energy and
  will restore 50% of your energy when eaten.
- The Tireless Run scroll combined with a Spirit Terrorbird familiar can be used by level
  52 [summoning](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=summoning_guide.htm)
  members to get a 2 point Agility boost and restore Energy based on 50% of your Agility level.

  the [As a First Resort...](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=184)
  quest can take a dip in the salt-water pool to get **unlimited** run energy for an amount of time dependent on your
  agility level.
- Free Players and Members can obtain
  an [Explorer's ring](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2item_id=7559) that
  comes in three varieties from completing all the tasks in the three levels of the Lumbridge Achievement Diary. You are
  able to operate it from one to three times a day (depending on the ring's level) to recover 50% of your energy.

### Teleport Spells

Depending on your magic level, and whether you are a member or not, you can use several different spells to teleport you
to major cities and locations all across the RuneScape world. Refer to
the [magic guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=magic_guide.htm) for more
details on these spells, however some are shown in the table below. Spells in grey rows are members only. However, there
are quest requirements for using certain teleports. To use the Ardougne teleport, you must have completed
the [Plague City](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=44) quest. To use
the watchtower teleport, you must have completed
the [Watch Tower](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=64) quest. To use
the Trollheim teleport, you must have completed
the [Eadgar's Ruse](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=77) quest. To
use the Ape Atoll teleport, you must have completed the Awowogei part of
the [Recipe for Disaster](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=134)
quest.

Members with the appropriate magic level can create teleport tablets at a lectern built in the study of a player-owned
house (
see [Construction](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=construction_beginner_guide.htm)
skill guide). Once enchanted, a teleport tablet can be used by any member regardless of magic level. A teleport tablet
is used by breaking it, and thus has only one use. Members can also build portals in
their [houses](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=construction_beginner_guide.htm),
and focus them as permanent free teleports to specific cities (Ardougne, Camelot, Canifis/Kharyrll, Falador, Lumbridge,
Varrock, or Watchtower/Yanille). Any house guest can use a portal regardless of magic level, as long as they meet any
quest requirement for access to that area.

Starred Teleports can be made into Teleport Tablets; others cannot. See
the [Magic Guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=magic_guide.htm#tabs) for
more verbose information.

**Note:** The "Lumbridge Home Port" teleport spell requires no runes and no experience is gained from it. Its primary
use is to return newer players to familiar grounds, if they should happen to get lost. This teleport spell takes time to
cast, so is not suitable for combat situations as, if you get interrupted, the spell will fail. You can only cast this
spell once every 30 minutes.

There are three 'Teleother' spells which a player can cast on another to teleport them. This will only work if the
target has his or her 'Accept aid' option on.

If you have completed
the [Desert Treasure](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=96) quest then
you will also have the ability to use the Ancient Magicks Teleports. These are listed below. The Canifis teleport (lvl
66 magic) is useful for people travelling to the Barrows and for people wanting to talk to the Canifis Slayer Master.
The different teleports to wilderness locations were formerly useful for PKing, and may still be useful for Treasure
Trails.

### Item Teleports

Within the lands of RuneScape there are a number of items you can obtain during the course of your travels and
adventures that will greatly assist you to get places in a hurry.

**Enchanted Lyre**  
When you
finish [The Fremennik Trials](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=79)
quest, you get a **lyre**. You can enchant it by offering a sacrifice at the Fossegrimen altar southwest of Rellekka.
Once enchanted, you can use it to teleport to Rellekka. Offering a raw shark earns two charges, a sea turtle earns four,
and a manta ray earns three teleport charges. Wearing a Ring of Charos(a) (
see [Garden of Tranquillity](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=115)
quest), you can charm the Fossegrimen into believing that your raw bass is a small shark, getting two charges. Once
you've used up the teleport charges, you have to recharge it by making another offering at the Fossegrimen altar.

**Ectophial**

The Ectophial is the reward for completing
the [Ghosts Ahoy!](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=89) quest. Click
on it to empty it at your feet, and you will immediately be transported to the Ectofuntus at Port Phasmatys. Your first
action there should be to refill your Ectophial, to have it ready for your next use. It's also a handy item for
worshipping the Ectofuntus - after you fill your Buckets with Slime in the basement, use it to avoid climbing 4 sets of
stairs to get back to ground level. Port Phasmatys is also a popular destination due to the Furnace just steps away from
the Bank, as well as a Range. For those without Ancient Magick, the Ectophial is also one method to reach nearby Canifis
and Mort Myre.

**Elf teleport crystal**

Members receive an elf teleport crystal during
the [Mourning's Ends part I](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=113)
quest. It teleports the player to Lletya in the Elven Land
of [Tirannwn](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=isafdar_arandar.htm). The
first crystal you receive during the quest holds 4 teleport charges. When the charges have been used up, Eluned (a
Roving Elf) will give it 3 new charges for 750gp, and your next recharge will cost less. Elf teleport crystals with zero
or one charge are also dropped by Elf warriors in Tirannwn.

**Skull sceptre**

The Skull sceptre is the first Free to Play teleport item, and will take you to the Barbarian Village (south of
Edgeville). It is obtained by collecting monster drops in
the [Stronghold of Security](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=stronghold_security.htm#rewards).
The pieces required are a skull right half, skull left half, bottom of sceptre and top of sceptre. Assemble the four
parts together, making a Skull Sceptre with 5 teleport charges. When the fifth teleport is used, the sceptre
disintegrates. Then you can build yourself a new one by obtaining the 4 parts and putting them together.

**Pharaoh's Sceptre**

The Pharaoh's sceptre is obtained from
the [Pyramid Plunder](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=pyramid_plunder.htm)
mini game, or may be purchased from other players. It can be used to teleport to any of the three pyramids:

-

Jalsavrah - [Pyramid Plunder](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=pyramid_plunder.htm)
mini game pyramid (room of the Guardian Mummy)

-

Jaleustrophos - [Agility Pyramid](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=agility_guide.htm#Pyramid)
-
Jaldraocht - [Ancient Magicks](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=ancient_magicks.htm)
Pyramid

The Sceptre can hold three charges. Once you have used the three charges, the Guardian Mummy will recharge it for 24
combs or pottery trinkets, or 12 stone trinkets, or 6 gold trinkets.

**Camulet**

The Camulet is a reward from
the [Enakhra's Lament](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=131) quest.
In addition to letting you speak to camels, it will teleport you to the center of the Enakrah's Lament pyramid. You can
then go up the ladders to the surface. For those without a Pharaoh's Sceptre, the Camulet is helpful for switching to
Ancient Magicks, since you arrive just west of the Jaldroacht pyramid. You can recharge the Camulet by using ugthanki
dung on it. This is acquired by using hot sauce from the kebab seller in Pollnivneach on the nearby camel trough.
See [The Feud](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=93) quest guide for
dung details.

**Grand Seed Pod**

The Grand Seed pod, a reward from
the [Gnome Delivery](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=gnome_restaurant.htm)
mini game, is useful for transportation back to the Grand Tree. There are two ways of using it. The first is to launch
it (outdoors only) and wait for it to be seen by a Gnome pilot who will transport you back to the Grand Tree. This will
also gain you some farming experience points. The second way is to squash which will result in you being teleported
immediately to the Grand Tree King. This method, though faster, will cause you to temporarily lose 5 farming levels.
Neither method functions past level 30 Wilderness and each pod can only be used once.

**Rum**

Special Rum (in a red or blue bottle) can be purchased for 20 pieces of eight from Honest Jimmy,
the [Trouble Brewing](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=trouble_brewing.htm)
mini game vendor. Click on it to drink it, and you will be transported directly to the Trouble Brewing mini game on Mos
Le'Harmless.

**Oldak's Marvellous Moving-over-distance Sphere**

Oldak sells teleport spheres from his laboratory in the northwest corner
of [Dorgesh-Kaan](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=dorgesh_kaan.htm) on the
main floor, just north of the bank. He charges two law runes and one molten glass for each sphere. To reach him in
Dorgesh-Kaan you must have completed
the [Death to the Dorgeshuun](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=141)
quest. He makes spheres for three destinations: Dorgesh-Kaan, the Goblin Village and the Plain of Mud. The Goblin
Village spheres are only offered to members who have completed
the [Another Slice of H.A.M.](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=175)
quest. The Plain of Mud spheres are only offered to members who have completed
the [Land of the Goblins.](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=181)
quest. The spheres are one-time-use teleports, like teleport spell tablets - they break when used. The Dorgesh-Kaan
sphere teleports you to one of several random spots in Dorgesh-Kaan.

**Karamja Gloves 3**

Obtained as a reward for completing all tasks in
the [Karamja Achievement Diary](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=karamja_achievement.htm),
these gloves will teleport you to a
secret [gem mine](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=shilo_underground_gem_mine.htm)
under Shilo Village. Simply operate the gloves to activate the teleport.

**Explorer Ring 3**

Obtained as a reward for completing all tasks in
the [Lumbridge Achievement Diary](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=lumbridge_achievement.htm),
this ring will teleport you to the cabbage field at the farm south of Falador. From inventory, choose Cabbage-port to
instantly activate, or while wearing it, operate it and select teleport to cabbage patch.

**Broomstick**

A reward from the Swept Away quest, the Apprentice right outside Shantay Pass will enchant this to teleport you directly
into
the [Sorceress's Garden](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=sorceress_garden.htm)
mini game. Wield it and then operate it to teleport.

**Runecrafting Altar Teleport Tablets**  
These teleport tablets that can be purchased from Wizard Elriss at the Runecrafting guild in the Wizard's Tower from
the [Great Orb Project Mini Game](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=great_orb_project.htm)
allow players to teleport directly outside the runecrafting altar as designated by the rune symbol on the teleport
tablet. The prices depend on the altar and increase as one progresses through the tablets (e.g. air teleport tablet will
be the cheapest while blood teleport tablet will be the most expensive). They can be bought with runecrafting guild
tokens and only last one use. They are non-tradable and only tablets that lead to free-to-play altars can be purchased
on free-to-play servers while all the tablets can be bought on pay-to-play servers.

***

### Gnome Spirit Trees

Once you have completed the members Tree Gnome Village quest, you can use the various Spirit Trees dotted around the
world to aid you in your travels. There are 4 in total:

- Tree Gnome Village
- Gnomes' Stronghold
- Northeast of Grand Exchange in Varrock
- Khazard battlefield

Simply speak to the tree to travel. However you cannot teleport between all the trees directly, you must use the main
Spirit Tree within the Tree Gnome Village as a hub.  
For instance, if I wished to teleport between the Khazard battlefield and the Gnomes' Stronghold, I would speak to the
Khazard tree to be teleported to the Tree Gnome Village, then speak to the main tree to be teleported to the
Stronghold.  
(**Note:** The Spirit Tree at the Stronghold can teleport to any tree, however only the tree at the Tree Gnome Village
can teleport you back to it).

Spirit trees generally have two forms, young and old. They shouldn't be to difficult to find as the are labelled on the
minimap as a teleport, however if your still having trouble finding them, here what you should be looking for.

Level
83 [farmers](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=farming_guide.htm#special)
have the option of growing a spirit tree at one of three patches: west of Draynor, southeast Etceteria, or northeast
Brimhaven. The player is only permitted to have one spirit tree planted at a time.

If you have reconnected the dying Spirit tree to the Anima Mundi
in [The Path of Glouphrie](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=179)
quest you will be given a new option for Spirit Tree teleporting.

- Mountains east of the poison waste

This is a small area west of the Castle Wars arena and has little use unless you wish to access
the [Sewer Slayer Dungeon](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=sewer_slayer_dungeon.htm).  
However you will also gain the ability to teleport between **any** two trees (i.e. You do not have to use the Tree Gnome
Village as a hub!) as well as a cool new animation.

***

### Gnome Gliders

Once you have completed the
members [Grand Tree](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=33) quest, you
can take advantage of the many Gnome glider locations to fly across RuneScape - free of charge! Shown below is the map
you see when you click on the Gnome pilot, with the translations shown as well. When you fly between two locations, a
small glider will be shown moving across the map. The Karamja location is northeast of Shilo Village on the eastern
coast of the island. After completing
the [One Small Favour](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=90) quest,
you will also have the option of flying to the Feldip Hills south of the Ogre city of Gu'tanoth. Note that you cannot
fly from the Digsite location, as the pilot is practicing "creative landings".

![Gnome Glider locations](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028im_/http://www.tip.it/runescape/img2/gnome_air.png)

If you are doing or have completed
the [Monkey Madness](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=82) quest, you
can talk to Daero at Blurberry's Bar (in the Grand Tree) to be taken to the secret military glider hangar. From here,
you can fly to Crash Island which is located east of Ape Atoll. You can talk to the gnome on Crash Island to take a boat
trip to the Atoll. You can follow the process backwards to return.

***

### Hot Air Balloons

After you have completed
the [An Enlightened Journey](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=150)
quest, you can sail high above the ground on each of the subsequent routes you help Auguste to unlock. Instructions and
pictures to unlock each route are in
the [Balloon Routes](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=unlocking_balloon_routes.htm)
guide.

Once you have successfully managed to unlock a destination, you can travel from there back to Entrana or any other
location you have also unlocked. To travel to a particular place, you need to bring 1 log of the type you originally
used to unlock it. Note that your weight must be less than 40kg.

| **Hot Air Balloon Destinations** |                 |                      |                                                                                                                                                      |

**Note:** The levels required to burn logs in the air is different than the levels required to burn them on the ground.
Also, you gain no firemaking experience for the log used to travel via a Hot Air Balloon once you have unlocked a route.

***

### Eagles

Intrepid hunters, once they have completed
the [Eagle’s Peak](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=151) quest, have
the opportunity to harness these noble birds of prey and ride them between four of the different hunting locations. This
is of great benefit for those hunters who are unable to access the fairy rings network.

You may travel from the woodlands (South of the Piscatoris Fishing Colony) to the following three hunting locations –
desert (west of Uzer), jungle (south of Feldip hills) or snow (north of Rellekka). From these three locations you can
only travel back to the woodlands.

So if you wanted to travel from the heat of the desert hunting area to the chill of the snow hunting area, your route
would have to be via the woodlands hunting area hub. Here you can disembark and catch a connecting flight to your
desired destination.

For further details refer to
our [Hunter Guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=hunting_guide.htm).

Additionally when you have completed
the [Back to my Roots](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=180) quest
you can also use the eagles to fly to the middle of the maze in the quest, which is located to the north east of Shilo
Village.

***

### Ships

There are many ports where you board ships by paying 30gp to an NPC (free if wearing the Ring of Charos(a) to get to
another location. If you have completed all the Easy tasks from
the [Achievement Diary for Karamja](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=achievement_diary.htm) ,
then the fee will be reduced to 15gp if you are wearing the Karamja Gloves 1 rewarded for completing the tasks. Jagex
has added a right-click "pay fee" option (avoids lengthy discussions about customs); it quickly deducts 30gp (or 15gp if
the gloves are equipped) from your pack. Below is the map you see while travelling on most ships.

![RuneScape Ships](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028im_/http://www.tip.it/runescape/img2/runescape_ships.gif)

- You can sail from Port Sarim to Karamja, and the other way around as well.
- Members can sail from Port Sarim to Entrana and back. There's no charge for this voyage, but you must have no weapons
  or armour in order to board.
- Members can sail from Ardougne to Brimhaven, and also back.
- Members can go Trawler fishing from Port Khazard. If your fishing trip is successful, it only takes you back to the
  Port where you receive your haul. However, if you take the trawler and fail to stay afloat (accidentally, or
  deliberately by doing nothing for around 2 minutes), the ship will sink. **You will no longer end up near Port Sarim,
  but instead, a little North of Port Khazard, below the Necromancer's tower.** Upon landing there you will take about 3
  HP damage
- The 'Lady of the Waves' is west of Shilo Village (go up a ladder), south opposite Cairn Isle. It travels to your
  choice of either Port Khazard or Port Sarim. Members can purchase ship tickets (25gp) from Seravel upstairs in the
  Fishing Shop in Shilo Village, or purchase passage from Captain Shanks on board the 'Lady of the Waves' for a variable
  fee (32 to 50 gp).

There are other voyages you can take that are not shown on the above map. These are sometimes part of new quests.

- Members can travel to Miscellania and Etceteria by talking to the Sailor on the dock in Rellekka. He will take you for
  free if you have competed

### Chartering Ships

Trader Stan has made his fleet of ships available for private charter around the world of RuneScape. To charter a ship,
simply speak to Trader Stan or any one of his sailors at the ports shown.

![Charter ships map](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028im_/http://www.tip.it/runescape/img2/gettingaround_charterships.gif)

Some ports will not be shown on your map until you complete a related quest. These are marked with an asterisk **\*** in
the tables below.

- Port
  Phasmatys - [Ghosts Ahoy!](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=89)
  quest (required per Jagex, though many players report being able to sail there anyway)

- Port Tyras - [Regicide](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=73) quest

- Mos Le'
  Harmless - [Cabin Fever](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=132)
  quest

The prices for chartering a ship are shown in the tables below. The first table shows
the [base prices](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=getting_around.htm#basecharter).

If you are wearing
the [ring of Charos(a)](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2item_id=4271) when
you book a charter, these prices will
be [halved](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=getting_around.htm#halfcharter).

Players who have completed
the [Cabin Fever](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=132) quest are
deemed to be experienced sailors. The price they pay to charter a ship will be also
be [less](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=getting_around.htm#halfcharter). (
Wearing a ring of Charos(a)
will [further reduce](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=getting_around.htm#quartercharter)
this charge).

### Canoeing

Members can build canoes and sail them up and down the River Lum, which runs from the wilderness to Lumbridge.  
You can make four different types of canoes based on your woodcutting level:

**Canoes**

| **Pic**                                                                                              | **Lvl** | **Canoe Name** | **Distance**             |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------|--------------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|

**Note:** Only the Waka canoe can travel to the wilderness.

To make a canoe chop down the "canoe tree" at any station. You can use any type of hatchet. Click to shape the canoe and
choose your design. Once you have made your canoe you can decide which station you want to go to. There is no canoe tree
in the wilderness. The wilderness is an ARRIVAL DESTINATION ONLY. You can travel between(from North to South):

- Wilderness(level 35)

- Edgeville

- Barbarian Village

- Champion's Guild

- Lumbridge

### Jewellery

If you wish to activate the teleport function of a particular piece of jewellery while it is in your inventory, simply
right click on it and select the rub option. This will bring up another interface allowing you to select a destination
or remain where you are.

To activate the teleport function of an item of jewellery while you are wearing it, go to the equipment menu, right
click on it and select the operate option. Again this will bring up an interface allowing you to select your
destination.

**Note:** The ring of life does not have a user-activated teleport option.

**Amulet of Glory**  
This amulet is crafted from the dragonstone gem, obtainable only from the crystal chest in Taverly. To open this chest,
you will need the crystal key which is made by joining its' two halves. Both the 'loop' half and the 'teeth' half are
rare drops from all monsters that also drop gems. You can rub it while in your inventory, or operate it while wearing it
and choose your destination. It doesn't work past level 30 wilderness. After four teleports, you will have to recharge
it at the Fountain of Heroes located in the basement of the Hero's guild, Heroes can mount an uncharged amulet of glory
in their quest hall for infinite teleports to the usual four destinations:

**Bracelet of Combat**  
Like the amulet of glory this bracelet is crafted from a dragonstone gem. You can rub it while in your inventory, or
operate it while wearing it and choose your destination. It doesn't work past level 30 wilderness. After four teleports,
you will have to recharge it at the totem pole in the entrance hall of
the [Legend's Guild](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=legends_guild.htm).
The four teleports are listed below.

Bracelet of Combat Teleports

**Necklace of Skills**  
Like the amulet of glory this necklace is crafted from a dragonstone gem. You can rub it while in your inventory, or
operate it while wearing it and choose your destination. It doesn't work past level 30 wilderness. After four teleports,
you will have to recharge it at the totem pole in the entrance hall of
the [Legend's Guild](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=legends_guild.htm).
The four teleports are listed below.

**Games Necklace**  
An enchanted Sapphire Necklace (be careful, not an amulet) initially has 8 charges. Rubbing it or operating it will
teleport you to one of the following places:

- the Burthorpe (Games room)

- the Barbarian Outpost, just outside the Barbarian Assault Minigame area

- The Clan Wars minigame.

- The Bounty Hunter minigame.

The necklace will not function past level 20 wilderness.

The Games room is close to the Burthorpe Slayer master, as well as
the [Rogues' Den](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=rogues_den_guide.htm) and
the [Warrior's guild](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=warriors_guild.htm).
It's also convenient to the Hero's guild if you are travelling there to recharge Amulets of Glory.

At the Barbarian Outpost you can visit the Barbarian agility arena or the Barbarian Assault Minigame area. It is also
convenient for the Lighthouse to kill regular Dagganoths, for Baxtorian Falls and the Fire Giants there, or to get to
the Gnome Stronghold via the agility shortcut.

**Digsite Pendant**  
This is made by enchanting a Ruby Necklace. To do this, you must have completed the Dig Site floor of
the [Varrock Museum](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=varrock_museum.htm)
and the Digsite Quest. During this, you can find a clean necklace. Show this to an archeologist to unlock the enchant
ruby necklace spell. When you rub or operate a ruby necklace, you will teleport to the North side of the Digsite. It has
5 charges.

**Ring of duelling**  
This is made by enchanting an Emerald ring. When you rub it or operate it, you have a choice to teleport to either the
Castle Wars area (west of Yanille and south of the Observatory), the Duel Arena east of Al Kharid or the Fist of Guthix
Lobby. It has 8 teleport charges and does not work past level 20 wilderness.

**Ring of Life**  
Made by enchanting a Diamond ring. Whenever your hit points fall to below 10% of your total, you will automatically be
teleported to your chosen respawn point (see
the [dying](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=getting_around.htm#dying)
section to see possible respawn points). It will also cure you of any poisoning upon teleportation. The ring
disintegrates after a single use. It doesn't work past level 30 wilderness or while duelling, and it does not have a
user-activated teleport option. The Ring of life **will \*not\* save you** if your enemy can wipe out your last 10% of
your HP at once.

### Magic Carpets

Ali Morrisane has started a network of Magic Carpet travel routes through the desert. It's twice as fast as running and
you can travel to a variety of locations within the Desert: Bedabin camp, ruins of Uzer, Pollnivneach, Nardah, Sophanem,
and Menaphos. It's particularly useful if you are doing one of the Desert-related quests or simply want to get to a
Desert city without having to endure the danger of dying of thirst and being attacked by wolves. Each trip is 200gp,
100gp after doing Rogue trader minigame, and further discounted if wearing the Ring of Charos(a). Certain routes will
only be available after you've done related quests as shown on the map.

### Carts

**Dwarven Mine Carts**  
If you have started the Giant Dwarf quest, you will have access to the underground city of Keldagrim and can utilise
their system of mining carts. For a fee of 100 or 150gp (discounted if wearing the Ring of Charos(a)), you can buy a
ticket to travel to and from Keldagrim (the Dwarven City) and these locations:

- Ice Mountain - Dwarven Mines
- White Wolf Mountain - Dwarven Passage

**Dorgesh-Kaan to Keldagrim Subway Train**  
After complete the Another Slice of H.A.M. quest get free rides on the subway between the underground cities of
Keldagrim and Dorgesh-Kaan. The Keldagrim station entrance is south of the Blast Furnace, while the Dorgesh-Kaan station
entrance is in the southwest corner of the city's middle level.

**Jungle Cart**

Vigroy has a cart in Shilo Village, and will cart you up to Brimhaven (by the dock) for a fee. The fee is 10 gp. To
avoid the dialogue, right-click "Pay fee" on the driver or "pay-fare" on the cart. Hajedy at the other end also has a
cart and is willing to take you on a journey in the opposite direction, also for 10 gp. Of course, you will need to have
completed the [Shilo Village](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=49)
quest to use this cart route.

### Fairy Rings

The Fairy Rings, accessed by starting the Fairy Tale pt. II Cure a Queen quest, provide an extensive network of travel.
NOTE: you do NOT need to meet the quest herblore and farming requirements to get far enough in the quest to access the
rings!

You must be wielding a Dramen (or Lunar) staff to use any fairy ring. All fairy rings outside of the Lost City of
Zanaris will only take you back to Zanaris, where you can dial another destination. Using the Zanaris fairy ring brings
up three dials (like a combination lock) which you can click to change to different letters. Each click turns the dial
clockwise to the next letter (the letters are not in alphabetical order). When the combination is adjusted as desired,
click the "Teleport to this location" words at the bottom.

The first list below shows the useful destinations by roughly dividing the RuneScape map into three sections: West,
Central, and East. The West area includes the members-only areas west of Taverly, excluding Karamja. The Central area
includes the F2P map area plus all of members-only Karamja. The East section is again members-only, covering Morytania
and the Kharidian Desert. These rough divisions are intended to help players plan their travel. The locations are listed
from north to south for each area.

A few possible combinations and destinations take you to isolated or island locations with no monsters, nothing to do
and nowhere else to go. Most unused combinations (not included in any of the tables) bring you back to Zanaris, within a
few steps of the fairy ring.

### Other methods

There are other little ways of sneaking around and taking short cuts, listed and described below.

**The Jail teleport**  
You can essentially teleport from the Shantay Pass to Port Sarim. Talk to Shantay and tell him you are an outlaw and '
Prepare to Die!' He will put you in the jail next to him and ask you to pay 5 gp to leave. Keep on refusing and you will
be taken to the 'high security' prison at Port Sarim. There you can simply "pick" the lock (thieving not required), walk
out and go your merry way. This method works on f2p as well as p2p.

**Magic Guild portals**  
On the second floor of the Mage's guild in Yanille there are three portals that will teleport you to different
wizard-related locations.

- The east portal teleports you to the Wizards' Tower south of Draynor Village.

- The south portal teleports you to the Dark Wizards' Tower just north of the Crafting guild.

- The west portal teleports you to Thormac the Sorcerer's house just southwest of the Seers' Village and Catherby.

**Dark Wizard teleport**  
This is a free teleport from the Dark Wizards' Tower (west of Falador, north of Makeover Mage and Crafting Guild) to
Lumbridge Swamp. Go to the top floor of the Dark Wizards' Tower and talk to Zandar Horfyre. He tries to get you to
leave. If you refuse, he teleports you to Lumbridge Swamp, very close to the Lost City entrance shed (west of the swamp
mine, north of water rune altar).

**The Abyss**  
The Abyss is located in another plane and only accessible to members through the Zamorakian Mage northeast of Edgeville.
For detailed information, see
our [map and commentary](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=abyss.htm) about
it. Once inside, you can choose which rift to exit through to end up at any of the Runecrafting altars. Read
our [Runecrafting guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=runecrafting_guide.htm)
on the advantages and disadvantages of this mode of transport.

**Ardougne-Wilderness teleport**  
In the west of the main city of Ardougne, west of King Lathas' castle and in front of the large walls of West Ardougne,
there is a small hut with a lever. Pulling this lever will teleport you to another hut
in [level 54 wilderness](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=atlas.htm). You
will need a knife or a weapon to escape from the Deserted Keep in the wilderness. This is widely used by members going
training or adventuring in the wilderness. You can also pull the opposite lever in the wilderness to teleport to the hut
in Ardougne, but this will not work if you have been teleblocked by a revenant.

**Wilderness Teleport Portals**  
In the Wilderness there are six portals that will randomly teleport you to one of the other portals located in the
Wilderness. To activate a portal touch one of the four pillars, then stand in the center. The portal may not work if
you've been teleblocked by a revenant. **Note:** the portals will teleport everyone in the area. Also you may get
teleported deeper into the Wilderness. The six locations are marked as glowing blue portals on
Tip.It's [Wilderness Map](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=atlas.htm):

- Southeast of the Rogues' Castle (level 50)

- West of the Lava Maze (level 45)

- South of the Lava Maze at Green Dragons (level 36)

- North of the Wilderness Bandit Camp (level 27)

- South of Graveyard of Shadows (level 18)

- South of Bounty Hunter (level 14)

**Mort Myre Swamp**  
Once you have completed the In Search of the Myreque quest, you will be able to use the following two methods to travel
through the Mort Myre Swamp more quickly. You can go down the trap door behind the Canifis Inn into
the [Myreque Dungeon](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=myreque_dungeon.htm),
search the wall, and take the other exit into 'the Hollows' in Mort Myre Swamp. Proceed south from here and over the
bridge until you find a boat which you can ride to arrive in Mort'ton. You can get a ride back if you pay Cyreg
Paddlehorn 10gp.

**Dying**  
When you die in RuneScape, you end up in Lumbridge Castle and only keep your three most valuable items (if you are
carrying stackable items such as coins, runes or arrows, you will only keep the three most valuable; if you have nothing
but 100K gp, you would keep 3 gp.) If you were 'skulled' then you keep no items. You keep an extra item in both cases if
you were using the 'Protect Item' prayer. Once you have completed the
members-only [Recruitment Drive](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=111)
quest, you can end up in Falador when you die instead. You can change your spawn point between Lumbridge and Falador by
talking to Sir Tiffy Cashein in Falador Park. On completion of
the [King's Ransom](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=178) quest and
the [Knight Waves Training Ground](https://web.archive.org/web/20090331232028/http://www.tip.it/runescape/?rs2quest_id=178#trainingground)
mini-quest, you can speak to Merlin to change your spawn point to Camelot.

**Party Room Teleport**  
When a drop valued at one million or more gp is happening in the Falador Party Room, bankers all over Runescape on that
particular world will offer free teleports there. You simply need to talk to one of these bankers and ask for a
teleport, and they will perform it for free.
