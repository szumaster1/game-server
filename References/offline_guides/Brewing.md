## Brewing

Brewing is much more complicated and time-consuming than other foods, but the results are quite useful, for most of them boost assorted stats.

### Fermenting vat

A Fermenting vat is used to brew ales and cider. They are located in the brewery in either Keldagrim or Port Phasmatys. 
Players put ingredients into it, wait, and later collect the brew in Beer glasses or Calquat kegs.

#### Steps for preparing the fermenting vat:

1. Place 2 buckets of water into the vat.
2. Add two lots of Barley malt.
3. (optional) Add a bag of The stuff
4. Place in the ingredient for brewing. Types of ales and ingredients
5. Add a pot of ale yeast.

### Ales
Head to the brewery in either Keldagrim or Port Phasmatys


#### Steps for brewing Ales:

1. 2 buckets of water added to fermenting vat.
2. 2 lots of barley malt added to fermenting vat. (made by cooking barley on a cooking range)
3. 1 bag of The stuff added to fermenting vat. (optional, 50% increase in chance of mature ale)
4. Add the ingredients that vary for the specific beer/ale you are making.
5. 1 pot of ale yeast added to fermenting vat. (bought from NPC near vat, players will need an Amulet of Ghostspeak and 5 Ecto-tokens AND an Empty pot for the one located in Port Phasmatys, 25 coins for Keldagrim, empty pot spawn near vat)
6. Next, wait for the brew to ferment. If the brew is not ready, the examine text will say, " ale is fermenting in this vat." If you attempt to turn the valve prematurely, you will receive the prompt, "Are you sure you want to drain the vat?" Note that fermenting often takes a good 24-72 hours!
7. Once it's done brewing (examine will say "This vat is filled with ale."), turn the valve between the vat and the attached barrel to move brewed ale to the barrel (make sure the barrel is empty first!)
8. Use 8 beer glasses on the barrel or 2 Calquat kegs
9. This will fill players' glasses or kegs with brew. 

Note: The contents of the vat will change colour as the fermenting progresses.

### Cider
To make cider, 16 cooking apples, a pot of ale yeast, and 4 empty buckets are required.

Head to the brewery and put four of the apples in the nearby cider barrel. The players' character will do a nice dance and squish the apples to a pulp, making a bucket of apple mush. Use empty buckets on the apple barrel to get 4 buckets of mashed apples.
Once all 4 buckets are filled, add them to the fermenting vat, then the ale yeast into the fermenting vat and wait.
Note: Remember, you do NOT need to put in water or barley to make cider.

- Mature brews
With normal brewing, a player can randomly make matured ale, shown by a (m) next to the drink. Matured ale is slightly stronger than normal ale.
- "The stuff" is available from Honest Jimmy for 5 Pieces of Eight at the Trouble Brewing minigame. It gives a 50% chance of brewing a mature ale of the type the player is brewing.
- Add "The stuff" after the barley and before other ingredients and yeast. If the player try to add it after the other ingredient or after the yeast, it's too late, and will be told he or she can't add that to this vat.

Failure: Occasionally ale will become bad, wasting all that time. Drain the vat and try again.

*   Most stat changes are relative to your level in that stat.
