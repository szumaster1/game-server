## The **Mage Training Arena** 

***

is a [Magic](https://runescape.wiki/w/Magic "Magic") [minigame](https://runescape.wiki/w/Minigame "Minigame") located to the north of the [Duel Arena](https://runescape.wiki/w/Duel_Arena "Duel Arena"). Using various spells, players earn [pizazz points](https://runescape.wiki/w/Pizazz_points "Pizazz points") in different minigames which they can use to buy items in a shop on the top floor of the arena. There is an [Entrance Guardian](https://runescape.wiki/w/Entrance_Guardian "Entrance Guardian") that was made to welcome visitors to the Training Arena.

### History

After the discovery of [Runes](https://runescape.wiki/w/Runes "Runes") by humans many accidents occurred as inexperienced mages attempted difficult spells. The wizards of the original [Wizards' Tower](https://runescape.wiki/w/Wizards%27_Tower "Wizards' Tower") created the arena and the various guardians so that mages could train with the more mundane spells. Unfortunately it was destroyed by warriors and rangers that were angered by the new art of magic. Recently the current denizens of the Wizards' Tower have recreated the Arena and Guardians and have also developed charmed warriors to defend the arena against further attacks.

***

### Requirements

A minimum of magic level of 7 is needed to participate in this minigame although that will only allow use of a single spell. Level 33 will allow player to use all spells in all areas of the minigame, the higher your [Magic](https://runescape.wiki/w/Magic "Magic") level is the more [Experience](https://runescape.wiki/w/Experience "Experience") points you will receive. Players will consume a great deal of runes here and it recommended they can craft them unless they have a large disposable income for purchasing the needed runes. Level 54 [Runecraft](https://runescape.wiki/w/Runecraft "Runecraft") is recommended to be able to craft every rune needed, however it is still possible to runecraft laws for the arena at level 44 Runecrafting. For more info, please see the [Law running](https://runescape.wiki/w/Law_running "Law running") guide.


[Clue scrolls](https://runescape.wiki/w/Clue_scroll "Clue scroll"), [caskets](https://runescape.wiki/w/Casket "Casket") and summoning familiars are not allowed inside the rooms.

## Rooms

***

### **Telekinetic Theatre**

In this room, a [Telekinetic Guardian](https://runescape.wiki/w/Telekinetic_Guardian "Telekinetic Guardian") may be found. The Telekinetic Guardian explains how the Telekinetic Theatre works. Players use the [Telekinetic grab](https://runescape.wiki/w/Telekinetic_grab "Telekinetic grab") spell to move a statue north, south, east, or west through a maze. To move the statue, players must stand on the side of the maze in the direction they wish to move the statue and then cast telekinetic grab on the statue. You do not have to be in line with the statue, if you cast the spell from the north face, the statue will move north.

A maze can take anywhere from 7 to 10 law runes to complete. To get a better view of where the statue is moving, right click the "Observe" option on the statue so you can get an aerial view of the statue's position within the maze. Note, that once the statue has started moving, the player cannot move until the statue had finished moving. When the player solves a maze, they will get 2 pizazz points, and the telekinetic guardian will teleport you to another maze if you wish to do so. After solving five mazes in a row you will get a bonus of 8 pizazz points, 10 law runes and 1,000 magic EXP. The player gains roughly 3,000 magic experience per five mazes completed.


If the player logs out, they will have to start the maze they are currently working on from the beginning. However, the maze total is recorded if the player leaves the room or even the arena and then returns to the room.


To approximate the Magic experience gained for each five mazes solved, one could assume a pessimistic cost of 10 law runes per maze or 50 law runes for every 5 maze bonus:

*   50 Laws x 43 magic EXP (Telekinetic Grab) = 2,150 exp (natural) or 3,150 exp after 1,000 exp bonus.


*   Subtracting the 10 Bonus Laws from the cost of 50 per bonus, you get 40 Laws actual cost to yourself per bonus.


*   Divide the 40 Law runes actual cost into 3,150 exp (approx) gained per five mazes and you gain about _78.75 magic exp per Law used!_


For pizazz points, again assuming 10 law runes per maze:

*   50 laws - 10 laws= 40 laws


*   40 laws/18 pizazz points = 2.22 laws per point, or about 731gp per pizazz point

### **Alchemist's Playground**

A player in the alchemists playground.

In this room, an [Alchemy Guardian](https://runescape.wiki/w/Alchemy_Guardian "Alchemy Guardian") may be found. The Alchemy Guardian explains how the Alchemist's Playground works. Players have to use [High Level Alchemy](https://runescape.wiki/w/High_Level_Alchemy "High Level Alchemy") or [Low Level Alchemy](https://runescape.wiki/w/Low_Level_Alchemy "Low Level Alchemy") spells to convert items in eight cupboards to gold coins. Every few seconds, these items switch from cupboard to cupboard, but are in the same order every time in a clockwise direction (note that this is the same as shown in the price window):

*   [Leather boots](https://runescape.wiki/w/Leather_boots "Leather boots")
*   [Adamant kiteshields](https://runescape.wiki/w/Adamant_kiteshield "Adamant kiteshield")
*   [Adamant medium helmets](https://runescape.wiki/w/Adamant_medium_helmet "Adamant medium helmet")
*   [Emeralds](https://runescape.wiki/w/Emerald "Emerald")
*   [Rune longswords](https://runescape.wiki/w/Rune_longsword "Rune longsword")
*   Empty
*   Empty
*   Empty

The amount of coins given for each item changes every 20 to 50 seconds, and the current values are shown in a table in the top-right corner of the screen (The values are the same for both High and Low Level Alchemy). The highest amount of coins available for a conversion is 30.

Sometimes a green arrow will appear next to an item (can take from 30 seconds to 6 minutes or more) and lasts until the items change; this means that for the item the arrow is indicating, no [nature runes](https://runescape.wiki/w/Nature_runes "Nature runes") will be required to convert that item. (_Item converted for free!_) One good strategy is to only convert items that are free to get free training. While this is a slower method, you save money, which is good for mages on a budget. It should be noted, however, that even though nature runes are not required for this method, you still need at least one nature rune in your inventory or your spell book will show the alchemy spells blacked out.

To quickly determine the location of any desired item, check one of the centre cupboards first immediately after the price list changes. Cupboards are empty in groups of three, so if the cupboard opened is empty, then it is likely that those next to it will also be empty. It is therefore best, to avoid empty cupboards, to skip to the opposite side at the opposite end of the row of cupboards.

For every 100 coins deposited in the Coin Collector (_Somewhere to put money._) the player will gain 1 pizazz point. The player also gains 2 magic experience per coin deposited, and 10 coins (deposited to the player's bank) for every 100 deposited. (If using high alchemy, the player gains up to 125 Magic experience per alch respectively.)

As the alchemy spells require only [fire](https://runescape.wiki/w/Fire_runes "Fire runes") and [nature runes](https://runescape.wiki/w/Nature_runes "Nature runes"), players are recommended to use a [Fire staff](https://runescape.wiki/w/Fire_staff "Fire staff"), and as this will mean both [High](https://runescape.wiki/w/High_Level_Alchemy "High Level Alchemy") and [Low Level Alchemy](https://runescape.wiki/w/Low_Level_Alchemy "Low Level Alchemy") will use the same amount of runes, players are recommended to use High Level Alchemy where possible, as this will give more experience.

To make the most efficient use of their time, players should try to alch items that convert for 30 coins. For those players that have limited money, they should prioritise alching items that are arrowed always, so to use less nature runes.

It is recommended that the player **only** deposit coins that are in 100s. If you have, say, 195 coins, it is a better idea to high alch something worth 5 coins and deposit the coins rather than wasting coins. It is not possible to deposit another 5 coins and get another point by doing that.

The maximum amount of coins that can be deposited is 12,000. NOTE: If you try to deposit more coins than this, you will be kicked from the room and you will lose ALL of your coins.

Deposit: _You've just deposited X coins, earning you X Alchemist Pizazz Points and X magic XP. So far, you're taking X coins as a reward when you leave!_

Message when leaving: _You still have coins in your inventory, do you still want to leave?_ _You've been awarded X coins straight into your bank as a reward!_

For finding out the cost of training here, assume that you are using high alch, and everything you alch is 30 coins:

*   100 coins/30 coins = 3.33

*   1 Nat = 30 coins (mage arena coins)

*   3.33 nats = 1 Point

*   1 Point = about 760 coins

### **Enchanting Chamber**


A player in the enchantment chamber.

(Due to the easy steps that you must follow to earn points in this room, you will receive less magic experience (75%) for casting the spells in the room. Also, you will need to work longer to earn lots of points in this room.)

In this room, an [Enchantment Guardian](https://runescape.wiki/w/Enchantment_Guardian) may be found. The Enchantment Guardian will explain how the Enchanting Chamber works. Players use enchanting spells to enchant various shapes ([Icosahedron](https://runescape.wiki/w/Icosahedron "Icosahedron"), [cube](https://runescape.wiki/w/Cube "Cube"), [pentamid](https://runescape.wiki/w/Pentamid "Pentamid"), and [cylinder](https://runescape.wiki/w/Cylinder "Cylinder")) located in the 4 corners of the room into [spheres](https://runescape.wiki/w/Sphere_(Mage_Training_Arena) "Sphere (Mage Training Arena)"). At the bottom of the screen is an icon that indicates which shape is to be transformed if you wish to gain pizazz points. These shapes will transform into orbs, granting 1 pizzaz point per cast.

The orbs can be deposited in the middle of the room: Every 20 will earn you a reward of either 3 blood, death, or cosmic runes. To save time, click the "Deposit Hole" to deposit all orbs at once instead of clicking each orb and depositing one by one.

For each ten shapes converted a bonus is awarded; on converting the tenth shape, the arena will award points according to the level of enchantment used to convert the tenth shape. For example if you used level 4 Diamond Enchant to convert the tenth shape, 4 points will be awarded. Please note that dragonstones do not count as shapes, and the bonus for the tenth item will be given even if you enchant the incorrect shape.

While the shapes at first glance appear to be designated into corners around the room, there is actually a single pile of shapes in each corner that 'belongs' in the corner opposite. This means that a player need only stay on one side of the arena to obtain all shape types, cutting down on run energy use.

6 dragonstones will spawn around the room every 5 minutes, which can be enchanted at any level. They give more bonus pizazz points depending on the level of enchantment you used and also turn into orbs. Points gained per dragonstone = 2x enchantment level used; therefore, the maximum points available for enchanting one of the 6 dragonstones is 12, (using level 6 onyx enchant). A player can minimise the number of cosmics used in this room by enchanting the dragonstones and hopping to another world to repeat. This no longer works - now you have to wait for the dragonstones to respawn.

Below are the point values received upon enchanting dragonstones, points awarded when enchanting a dragonstone depend upon the enchantment level used: -

*   Level 1 Sapphire enchant = 2 points (level 7 magic)

*   Level 2 Emerald enchant = 4 points (level 27 magic)

*   Level 3 Ruby enchant = 6 points (level 49 magic)

*   Level 4 Diamond enchant = 8 points (level 57 magic)

*   Level 5 Dragonstone enchant = 10 points (level 68 magic)

*   Level 6 Onyx enchant = 12 points (level 87 magic)

***

### **Creature Graveyard**

A player in the creature graveyard.

In this room, a [Graveyard Guardian](https://runescape.wiki/w/Graveyard_Guardian "Graveyard Guardian") may be found. The Graveyard Guardian explains how the Creature Graveyard works. Players have to use the [Bones to Bananas](https://runescape.wiki/w/Bones_to_Bananas "Bones to Bananas") spell to turn 4 different variations of [Animals' bones](https://runescape.wiki/w/Animals%27_bones "Animals' bones") into [bananas](https://runescape.wiki/w/Banana "Banana"), which are then deposited in the slots on the walls in the room to gain pizazz points. Each type of bone gives a different number of fruit. For every 16 fruit deposited in the slot, 1 pizazz point is gained.

Every so often the player will be hit for 2 damage by falling bones. Players will need to eat some of their converted bananas to stay alive, if they wish to stay within this room for any prolonged period of time. Protection prayers will not prevent the falling bones from causing damage: Death will result in a penalty of 10 pizazz points lost and the player's being sent back to the arena's main hall. You will not lose your equipment. Logging out in the room will not affect your pizazz points, but you will lose all fruit in your inventory.

One strategy is to turn the bones into 20 bananas, eat 4 of the bananas, and deposit the other 16. This will heal you about as fast as you are being injured. It also gives you roughly 50 magic xp and 1 pizazz point for each nature rune.

The [Bones to Peaches](https://runescape.wiki/w/Bones_to_Peaches "Bones to Peaches") spell can be used in place of Bones to Bananas; [peaches](https://runescape.wiki/w/Peach "Peach") heal 8 [Hitpoints](https://runescape.wiki/w/Hitpoints "Hitpoints"), whereas bananas heal 2. If you wish to use the spell [Bones to Peaches](https://runescape.wiki/w/Bones_to_Peaches "Bones to Peaches") in place of [Bones to Bananas](https://runescape.wiki/w/Bones_to_Bananas "Bones to Bananas"), you can purchase the spell from the rewards guardian who is situated on the arena's upper floor.

Players who wish to not eat in the room and thereby save nature runes may exit the room when they are close to dying and heal at the Al-Kharid duel arena hospital. Then they may come back to the Graveyard, fully healed and ready to go again.

As a further reward, blood, death, earth, water, or nature runes are given to players when they deposit 16 fruit.

If you have or can afford one, a [Mud battlestaff](https://runescape.wiki/w/Mud_battlestaff "Mud battlestaff") or [Mystic mud staff](https://runescape.wiki/w/Mystic_mud_staff "Mystic mud staff") can be very helpful as Bones to Bananas will only require one nature rune, with the [Mud battlestaff](https://runescape.wiki/w/Mud_battlestaff "Mud battlestaff") replacing the required [Water runes](https://runescape.wiki/w/Water_rune "Water rune") and [Earth runes](https://runescape.wiki/w/Earth_rune "Earth rune").

Please note that you can NOT use any familiars inside the Mage training arena, that includes the [bunyip](https://runescape.wiki/w/Bunyip "Bunyip") so you can't use that instead of eating. Also note that the usage of a [Regen bracelet](https://runescape.wiki/w/Regen_bracelet "Regen bracelet") is very useful if you use [Prayer](https://runescape.wiki/w/Prayer "Prayer") Rapid Heal so you get one health every 15 seconds.

Another option is to bring a small amount of high level food (lobsters, monkfish, etc.) into the arena and eat those when needed.

A good way to last forever is after you have deposited the bananas or peaches, where it says congratulations.... etc etc just wait. You Will regain health but Not get hit with the falling bones.

Suggested Strategy Staffs:

Use up 4 spaces in your inventory; your nature runes, the blood runes and death runes you will get as rewards and either earth or water runes, depending on what staff you brought. If using a mud staff, choose either one--it doesn't matter, they're just place holders. It is important to keep 24 free inventory slots, so be sure to drop the the runes you don't need.

Next, simply choose a pile nearest to the food chute and pick up 12 bones of any type. You will always get 24 bananas using the spell. Since you get a pizazz point for every 16 bananas deposited, with 24 bananas you will be alternating between gaining one point and two points every batch that you deposit, or 3 pizazz points every 2 deposits. If you are using the healers at the Duel Arena, keep an eye on your point total and only leave after you've seen it jump 2 points, otherwise you will have wasted 8 bananas.

## Trivia

*   While at time of release the arena was very popular with mages, it is now arguably visited more often by high-level [woodcutters](https://runescape.wiki/w/Woodcutting "Woodcutting") for its two [magic trees](https://runescape.wiki/w/Magic_tree "Magic tree") quite near to the duel arena [bank](https://runescape.wiki/w/Bank "Bank").


*   [Charmed Warriors](https://runescape.wiki/w/Charmed_Warrior "Charmed Warrior") can be found all over the Mage Training arena, possibly to protect the arena in the event of future attack.  
    It's also a possibility, that because of their invisible state, they reside there to prevent automatic clicking, and thus macroing, in the arena.


*   An odd Portal can be found caged in a tower above the mage arena, near the [Rewards Guardian](https://runescape.wiki/w/Rewards_Guardian "Rewards Guardian"). While it has no purpose at this time, it appears considerably similar to a [house portal](https://runescape.wiki/w/House_portal "House portal"), albeit much smaller. Its examine text suggests that this may lead somewhere in the future, stating: "Hidden away, I wonder where it goes?"

*   Additionally, the chamber names (Graveyard, Alchemist, Telekinetic & Echantment) spell out GATE.
