## **Puro-Puro** 

***

is a magical world, separate from Gielinor, and is the main location for the [Impetuous Impulses](https://cdn.2009scape.org/wiki/minigames/puro_puro "Impetuous Impulses") minigame. It is the homeworld of the [implings](https://cdn.2009scape.org/wiki/minigames/puro_puro "Impling"), [imp](https://runescape.wiki/w/Imp "Imp")\-like creatures who steal various items from the citizens of Gielinor, then flee to Puro-Puro via crop circles located throughout _RuneScape_. However not all implings manage to find their way back, and therefore some may remain trapped on Gielinor. In recent times the portal openings have remained for longer, allowing certain adventurers to find their way to Puro-Puro.

Puro-Puro contains all the implings, and players can gain access to it either at the [Zanaris](https://runescape.wiki/w/Zanaris "Zanaris") wheat field, which contains a permanent portal, or the various wheat fields around RuneScape, which have temporary crop circle portals. Players who have access to Zanaris can assist those who do not by talking to the [wandering impling](https://runescape.wiki/w/Wandering_impling "Wandering impling") near the crop circle to find out where the temporary portal is located at that time. Players can simply step through a crop circle's portal to arrive in Puro-Puro.

If a player has a [Magic box](https://runescape.wiki/w/Magic_box "Magic box") in his inventory, the player will not be able to enter Puro-Puro; instead, a message appears in a chatbox: “Something prevents you from entering. You think the portal is offended by your imp boxes. They're not popular on imp and impling planes.”

### **The Maze**

Currently, the Maze is the only accessible feature of Puro-Puro, and contains a number of Implings of varying types. As mentioned above all the player needs to do is enter a portal, and they will find themselves just outside the Maze. However, to get in the maze, one also needs a [Hunter](https://runescape.wiki/w/Hunter "Hunter") level of 17, which is required to catch the lowest level of [implings](https://runescape.wiki/w/Implings "Implings"), baby implings. [Elnock Inquisitor](https://runescape.wiki/w/Elnock_Inquisitor "Elnock Inquisitor") is also located outside the Maze, and will give the player advice and instructions for the Impetuous Impulses minigame. Due to the magical nature of Puro-Puro the Maze is constantly changing, with new walls and passages appearing every few minutes, and the player's mini-map will also malfunction when on this world.

The Maze is constructed of walls of wheat which can be pushed through to gain strength experience although every now and then sections in the wheat walls become "Wilting Wheat" for a couple of seconds before disappearing, giving small passages through the walls. It will soon grow again, becoming "Growing Wheat" for a few seconds then it will be a "Wheat Wall" again.

### Trivia
* If a player [teleports](https://runescape.wiki/w/Teleport "Teleport") out of Puro-Puro, they will briefly see the minimap during the [teleport](https://runescape.wiki/w/Teleport "Teleport") animation. It consists of basically wheat shapes, but it also shows where the current [implings](https://runescape.wiki/w/Impling "Impling") are, and where the holes in the wheat walls are. Keep in mind that the holes in the wheat change quickly and should not be considered as a permanent location.
